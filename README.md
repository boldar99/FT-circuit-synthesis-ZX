The ability to fault-tolerantly prepare cat states, also known as multi-qubit GHZ states, is an important primitive for quantum error correction. It is required for Shor-style syndrome extraction, and can also be used as a subroutine for doing fault-tolerant state preparation of CSS codewords. Existing approaches to fault-tolerant cat-state preparations have been found using computationally expensive heuristics involving SAT solving, reinforcement learning or exhaustive analysis. In this paper we constructively find (nearly) optimal circuits for cat-states in a scalable way. In particular, we derive formal lower bounds on the number of CNOT gates required for circuits implementing n-qubit cat-states that don't spread errors of weight at most t for values t = 1, ..., 6. We do this by using fault-equivalent rewrites of ZX-diagrams to reduce it to a problem of characterising certain 3-regular simple graphs. We then find circuits that match this lower bound for all n<= 50 and t <= 6. We additionally show how to trade CNOT count against depth, in particular allowing us to construct constant-depth fault-tolerant implementations using O(n) ancilla and O(n) CNOT gates.
